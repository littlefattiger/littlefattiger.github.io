It is the book Deep learning with python, author FRANÇOIS CHOLLET.

# Chapter 1
   1.1. Deep Learning is used for supervised learning. Initially itintroduce _loss function_, _Backpropagation_ for basic concept. The target for training is to minimize loss function. Talk about the history and development of AI.

   1.2. Brifely talk about the machine learning model before DL.1- Naive Bayes is a type of machine-learning classifier based on applying Bayes’ theorem while assuming that the features in the input data are all independent (a strong, or “naive” assumption, which is where the name comes from). 2- Logistic regression is for classification problem but with name regression. 3- Early DL. Its development is from the invention of backpropagation. 4- kernel methods. SVM is most famous. Mapping data to high dimention and the decision boundary can be expressed as hyperplane. 5- Decision tree. Random forest and GBM. 6 The development of DL on ImageNet and some competition. DL can do automatical feature engineer. Also talked about its benefit.
   
   1.3 The reason why DL develop. It is due to hardware, data, algorithm and investment. 
   
   In general, besides the basic model, we only need to learn GBM and DL. On GBM, we need to learn XGBoost, and light GBM.

# Chapter 2
   2.1 Show a DL example in MNIST with less than 20 line code of python.
   
   2.2 Example of tensor.
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
